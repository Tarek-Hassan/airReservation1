<div class="about">
<p>Tourism is the travel for recreational, leisure, family or business purposes, usually of a limited duration. Tourism is commonly associated with trans-national travel, but may also refer to travel to another location within the same country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes</p>
<p>Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity. Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases it is of vital importance.</p>
<p>Misr travel was established in 1934 by the great Egyptian economist Talaat Harb, to be first and oldest travel company in Egypt and the Middle East. Throughout that period Misr Travel has been managed by a long line of influential economists and politicians. One of the most famous leaders was Mr. Mohamed El Sakka who successfully managed Misr Travel for 20 years (1969–1989). During this period, the company witnessed rapid expansions. Branch offices were inaugurated all over Egypt and around the world. Magawish Village was built to be the first resort on the Red Sea, in Hurghada. Last but not least was the launch of the first Nile cruises between Luxor and Aswan. Today Misr travel extends its services in Egypt and around the world.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1934, MISR TRAVEL’s team has been working restlessly to develop projects that would positively impact the tourism industry in the region. I am genuinely grateful to every team member who has faithfully supported the company and helped achieve additional steps on the road to success. I am equally grateful to our collaborators, around the world who trust and believe in us. True sense of responsibility, faith, loyalty and service are the key aspects behind the reputable name of MISR TRAVEL. I have the pleasure to introduce our new website, in which we have compiled a collection of our services both in Egypt and around the world. We constantly strive to provide the highest quality of service and maintain a leading position in the local and international markets through continuously improving our knowledge, capabilities, and competitiveness.</p>
